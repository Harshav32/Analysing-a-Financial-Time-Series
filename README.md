# Analysing a Financial Time Series
 The project’s main goal is to forecast financial time series data using R and Excel. We use Excel for short-term forecasting in Part 1 of the project, and R is used for time series analysis in Part 2. The project’s goal is to investigate various forecasting methods and evaluate how well they work at projecting financial asset values in the future.
