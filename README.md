# Analysing a Financial Time Series
 The project’s main goal is to forecast financial time series data using R and Excel. We use Excel for short-term forecasting in Part 1 of the project, and R is used for time series analysis in Part 2. The project’s goal is to investigate various forecasting methods and evaluate how well they work at projecting financial asset values in the future.
 
Part 1: Using Excel for Short-Term Forecasting
Using straightforward line plots, we first visually examine the historical stock prices of Apple (AAPL) and Honeywell (HON) in Part 1. We can find any underlying trends, seasonal patterns, or anomalous behaviors in the data by using these visualizations. We then use exponential smoothing techniques to predict the prices of stocks for the upcoming period. We experiment with different values of the smoothing parameter (α) to find the best values that yield the most accurate forecasts for each stock. Furthermore, we study the effect of changing the trend parameter (β) on forecast accuracy and carry out adjusted exponential smoothing.

Section 2: Time Series with R
We move on to using R to perform time series analysis in Part 2. Using R packages like quant mod, we can obtain five years’ worth of historical stock price data for HON and AAPL. To capture any underlying temporal patterns and seasonality, we then fit ARIMA models to the stock prices of AAPL and HON. To evaluate the time series data’s stability, stationarity tests are run. Furthermore, we use auto.arima() or Time-series models are automatically chosen and fitted to stock prices using Holt-Winters functions. Using similar methods, we extend our analysis to price prediction for dry wine.
This project aims to provide a thorough understanding of short-term forecasting techniques for financial time series data by combining Excel and R methodologies. We acquire valuable skills for making educated forecasts in real-world scenarios and obtain insights into the dynamics of financial markets through practical exploration and analysis.
